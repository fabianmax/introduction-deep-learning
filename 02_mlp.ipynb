    "Recall that a learning problem can be understood as approximating some function **$f^*$**, e.g. $y = f^*(x)$ maps the **input $x$** to some **output $y$**. And a learning algorithmen tries to learn the values of parameters $\\theta$ so that a given function $y = f(x;\\theta)$ approximates $f^*$ in the best possible way.   \n",

    "In the case of the perceptron, $f(x;\\theta)$ was the weighted some of the inputs and $\\theta$ was the weight vector ${[w_1, w_2, ..., w_n]}$ (and the bias $b)$. A multiplayer perceptron (MLP), also called Deep Learning, Deep feedforwards network, or feedforwards neural network, expands this idea by composing many functions together:\n",

One way to solve this problem is to manually engineer a feature vector $\\phi(x)$ from the input vector $x$ using a nonlinear transformation $\\phi$. We than use $\\phi(x)$ instead of $x$ to solve the problem at hand. \n",
